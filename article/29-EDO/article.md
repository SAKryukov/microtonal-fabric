SA??? This in-browser synthesizer creates instruments to be used in musical applications, offers advanced additive and subtractive synthesis techniques. It is based on Web Audio API and relies only on the browser, does not require any server-side part. It creates the synthesizers of the musical instruments. The synthesizers can be exported and embedded in a Web application.
