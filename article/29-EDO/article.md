Abstract:

A specialized microtonal musical instrument is specialized to 29 EDO tonal system. It is based on Sound Builder synthesis based on Web Audio API and relies only on the browser, does not require any server-side part. It offers three on-screen keyboard layouts, two of them invented by the pioneers of microtonal music, and another one by the author of this article.
