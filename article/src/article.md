## Introduction

This is the second article  in the series dedicated to musical study using specialized keyboards based on the computer keyboard. In my previous article, *[Musical Study with Isomorphic Computer Keyboard](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1201737/Musical-Study-with-Isomorphic-Computer-Keyboard)*, I tried to explain very basic mathematical and physical aspects of music and put forward a keyboard structured to be very suggestive of music harmony. However, the application illustrates everything on much less general case of common-practice [common-practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_practice_period) [tone system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_tuning).

The application I introduce in the present article covers this case, but is mainly focused on [microtonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtonal_music) systems. It provides more flexible ways for the very basic study of the field. I will often refer to certain points in my previous article. In the present article, I'm not going to get into theoretical reasoning much, mostly because my own study of the microtonal music is only starting.

## Why Microtonal?

There can be very many answers to this question. Not trying to cover the topic, I'll try to point out, maybe in a naive and rough way, two aspects I consider the most fundamental:

1. Traditional Western [equal-temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament) faces serious problems. Strictly speaking, its harmony does not sound quite harmonically. Basic sense of harmony is based on fundamental physical and mathematical principles independent from particular culture. At the same time, [transpositional equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_%28music%29#Transpositional_equivalence) is impossible to achieve with strict harmonics — In my previous article, [I tried to explain it](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1201737/Musical-Study-with-Isomorphic-Computer-Keyboard#heading.rational-and-irrational-numbers). However hearing the defects require pretty well-trained ear. So, here is the first principle: with microtonal systems, it's possible to play music, which sounds very traditional, but more with improved harmony. At the same time, it's possible to play something very different from and unusual — let's proceed to the second point. 

2. How about the possibility to create really new music? From the first glance, it may sound impossible. I often heard from people, including musicians, that such music is awfully "out of tune". Is it, really? I think, it depends. The ability to perceive microtonal music can be blocked by too strong bonding with cultural environment. The musical sense is a complicated combination of fundamental laws of nature and culture — I also [tried to explain it](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1201737/Musical-Study-with-Isomorphic-Computer-Keyboard#heading.culture-versus-physics), very roughly. It simply means that understanding of anything which can be called music always required involvement in culture and a lot of experience. Microtonal music just needs involvement in wider cultural context and even more experience.
