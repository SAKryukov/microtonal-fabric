## Microtonal Fabric

[Microtonal Fabric](https://SAKryukov.github.io/microtonal-fabric) is a microtonal music platform based on WebAudio API. It is a framework for building universal or customized microtonal musical keyboard instruments, microtonal experiments and computing, music study, and teaching music lessons with possible remote options.

All applications presented by this project can be played live using a Web browser.

The applications support standard touchscreen. With a touchscreen, one can play with ten fingers, any chords, glissando (important) in any combinations. So a touchscreen is highly recommended. Without a touch screen, a user still can play with a mouse/touchpad and, in special cases, a computer keyboard.

Browsers based on V8 engine are recommended, such as Chromium, Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi, Microsoft Edge v.&thinsp;80.0.361.111 or later, and more…

### Live-Play Applications

[SoundBuilder](https://SAKryukov.github.io/microtonal-fabric/code/SoundBuilder)

[Tonal System Comparison](https://SAKryukov.github.io/microtonal-fabric/code/tone-system-comparison) application

[Multi-EDO Chromatic Lattice](https://SAKryukov.github.io/microtonal-fabric/code/Multi-EDO/index.html), isomorphic chromatic keyboard

Microtonal Playground:

- [With Aura's Diatonic Scales](https://SAKryukov.github.io/microtonal-fabric/code/playground) (see also the [original publication](https://en.xen.wiki/w/User:Aura/Aura's_Diatonic_Scales) on these scales by [Dawson Berry](https://en.xen.wiki/w/Dawson_Berry))
- [With 12-EDO Diatonic Scales](https://SAKryukov.github.io/microtonal-fabric/code/playground/custom-demo/12-EDO.html)

With Microtonal Playground, the user can define any tonal system in terms of rational-number intervals, real-number intervals, or fixed frequencies, and, optionally, custom labels. When this data is passed to the application, the user can play it.

Specialized [29-EDO](https://SAKryukov.github.io/microtonal-fabric/code/29-EDO) keyboards

_[Musical Study with Isomorphic Computer Keyboard](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1201737/Musical-Study-with-Isomorphic-Computer-Keyboard)_, August 16, 2017<br/><small>This is the first work of the keyboard-related cycle, and it is not microtonal. However, it contains some theoretical introduction applicable to other works, which are essentially microtonal.</small>
