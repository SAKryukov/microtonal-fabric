## Microtonal Chromatic Lattice Keyboard — see [Live Play](https://sakryukov.github.io/microtonal-chromatic-lattice-keyboard)

This project offers a musical keyboard of a special structure in the form of [lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_%28group%29) resembling computer keyboard. This *rank-two* structure offers certain benefits over traditional *sequentially-structured* keyboards and is especially suitable for [microtonal music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtonal_music). In its use, the keyboard is highly suggestive of the fundamental principles of music harmony. The tone mapping is based on the [Wicki-Hayden layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicki-Hayden_note_layout), but the geometry is different: it is simpler; and its symmetry matches the symmetry of the tone system more closely.

The software is a pure in-browser application using [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API). It continues the work at the similar keyboard (not microtonal) for Windows and .NET: *[Musical Study with Isomorphic Computer Keyboard](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1201737/Musical-Study-with-Isomorphic-Computer-Keyboard)*.

### Supported [Tone Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_tuning):
- [Just Intonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation) (only [presented](https://sakryukov.github.io/microtonal-chromatic-lattice-keyboard/tone-system-comparison/tone-system-comparison.html) on the [chromatic-circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_circle) keyboard)
- [Common-practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_practice_period) [12 EDO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament)
- [19 EDO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19_equal_temperament)
- [29 EDO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19_equal_temperament)
- [31 EDO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31_equal_temperament)

### Compatibility
Most applications require advanced JavaScript engine and modern standard browser.

Browsers based on [Blink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine))+[V8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)) engines are recommended, such as Chromium, Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi, Microsoft Edge v. 80.0.361.111 or later, and more…

### Features:
- For three chromatic tone systems, the same keyboard is used; the choice of tone system can be changed dynamically
- Due to the very special keyboard layout, basic playing skills acquired and techniques learned for one tone system are immediately applicable to other tone systems
- Side-by-side comparison of the sound of tones and chords in different tone systems
- Chord generation
- Optional chord visualization
- Compatible browsers include, but not limited to Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla SeaMonkey and Opera
