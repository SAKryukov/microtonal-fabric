<p>Microtonal Fabric is a microtonal music platform based on WebAudio API. It is a framework for building universal or customized microtonal musical keyboard instruments, microtonal experiments and computing, music study, and teaching music lessons with possible remote options.</p>
<p>All applications presented by this project can be played live using a Web browser.</p>
<p>The applications support standard touchscreen. With a touchscreen, one can play with ten fingers, any chords, glissando (important) in any combinations. So a touchscreen is highly recommended. Without a touch screen, a user still can play with a mouse/touchpad and, in special cases, a computer keyboard.</p>
<p>Browsers based on V8 engine are recommended, such as Chromium, Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi, Microsoft Edge v. 80.0.361.111 or later, and more…</p>

However, it contains some theoretical introduction applicable to other works, which are essentially microtonal.</small></p>
